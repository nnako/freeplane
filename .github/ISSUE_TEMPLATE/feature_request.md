### Title

Describe the requested feature in one sentence.
Example: “Add a batch rename function for tags.”

### 1. Current Workflow Challenges

Explain how you currently handle the task and the specific problems or frustrations you face. Mention how often this issue occurs and how much it impacts your workflow.
Example: “I manually search for each tag and rename nodes one by one. This is time-consuming and often leads to mistakes. I encounter this problem every few weeks when reorganizing large maps with dozens of tags.”

### 2. Proposed Functionality

Describe how the feature should work, step by step. Focus on the essential aspects for the feature to be useful.
Example: “A tool that lets me select a tag, enter a new name, and apply the change across the entire map.”

### 3. Use Case and Expected Benefits

Explain how the feature would fit into your workflow and what practical improvements it would bring.
Example: “This feature would save me time and reduce errors when reorganizing tags. I wouldn’t need to search for each tag manually anymore.”

### 4. Example Map and Supporting Materials

Provide concrete examples if possible, such as a zipped mind map file or screenshots showing where the feature would be useful. When you suggest new user interface elements, include mockups or sketches to illustrate your idea. These examples help clarify your request and show its practical application.
Example: “Attached is a part of my map where I use tags for project management. I also included a sketch of how the feature could work.”
